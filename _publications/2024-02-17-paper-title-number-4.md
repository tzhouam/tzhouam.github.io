title: "OAWM: Generative World Model with Object-Level Representations and Actions"
collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: /publication/paper1
excerpt: 'Learning the world model from videos has been deemed as a way to train foun-
dation models for vision-based control tasks. Since most videos online doesn’t
have action label, some methods propose to infer the latent action from videos to
scale up the learning. However, current methods are restricted to the videos where
there is a clear distinction between one agent (in motion) and environment (still),
limiting the potential to use massive videos online. To address this limitation, we
propose to infer the object-centric representations and actions from the video and
learn a world model using them. This method solves the latent action inference
ambiguity problem in scenes where there are multiple moving objects. It also nat-
urally enables better counterfactual imagination and planning. Importantly, it’s
way more computationally efficient during planning. Meanwhile we manage to
generate high quality natural videos using these latent representations. Thereby,
we are able to think abstractly meanwhile see it vividly.'
