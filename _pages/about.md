I'm a second year master student from [Computer Science](https://www.cs.ucla.edu/), [University of California, Los Angeles(UCLA)](https://www.ucla.edu/). My research interest includes Computer Vision, Multi-Modal Model and Robotics.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Demetri Terzopoulos](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~dt/) of [Computer Graphics & Vision Laboratory](http://gravilab.cs.ucla.edu/). I was advised by [Prof. Xiaojuan Ma](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~mxj/) and [Prof. Hao Chen](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~jhc/) from [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/), [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/).
